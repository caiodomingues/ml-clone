# UI Clone - Mercado Livre

This project was made for study purposes, where I've tried to clone the interface from [Mercado Livre (ML)](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/).
You can see the result [here](https://ml-clone.vercel.app/).

## Todo

- [ ] Responsivity
- [ ] Missing elements from ML
- [ ] Use some Fake API

## About

It was made following [@guilhermerodz](https://github.com/guilhermerodz) tutorial's at [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat), you can see the original result of the video through [this repository](https://github.com/rocketseat-content/youtube-clone-mercadolivre).

The result is slightly different from [@guilhermerodz](https://github.com/guilhermerodz) because I've added some missing components, any feedback is welcome.
